John, accept it. It’s a fact. K-Pop isn’t a music genre. It’s a cultural sinkhole. You’re actually worsening society as a whole with your degeneracy. Idolising and worshiping the generic, auto tuned artists based on their identity instead of their musical talent harms the global music industry. Every heard of an ugly Korean singer? I didn’t think so, John. Your support of this propagates harmful beauty standards across impressionable youth worldwide which leads to poor mental health and eating disorders. Do you want that John? Didn’t think so, asshole.
