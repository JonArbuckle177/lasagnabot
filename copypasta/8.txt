Garfield leans towards Jon. "Where's my lasagna, Jon" Garfield whispers seductively into Jon's ear. "Garfield, I can't afford lasagna." Jon lets out with a shiver. "Well you're gonna have to give me something." Garfield utters into Jon's virgin ears. That would be a night to remember. Jon wakes up, chained to his bed. He lets out a cry for help. "Help me! Someone!" Jon screams out into the V O I D. Jon soon realized it was futile, and closed his eyes for a while. When he opened them, he saw Garfield at his feet. "Jon, where's my FUCKING lasagna?" Garfield lashed out. Jon was now bare ass naked. He didn't know how, but Garfield somehow vored his clothes, as he was 10 times bigger than normal. "I don't know!" Jon cried out. The room didn't look like his room anymore, it was all black. He looked back, and Garfield had grown in size again. "I'm so fucking hungry, Jon." Garfield said. "I have SOME money, I can buy y-" Jon was interrupted by the subtle crunch of the bedframe, Garfield had eaten that, too. He had eaten everything except Jon and his bed. "I was so hungry, Jon, I ate everything." Garfield's voice was getting deeper as he crunched into the bed, box springs getting caught in his teeth, but immediately getting sucked back into the endless void of Garfield's stomach. "I saved you for last, Jon." Jon realized any escape attempt wouldn't work, and he couldn't plead, so he just accepted his death. Jon heard a crunch as both of his feet were bitten off by Garfield. A dark orgasm of pain writhed through his body. He cried out, but it was futile. The rest of his legs were already gone. His torso was next, Garfield enjoying all of it. Blood surged out of the wounds, into Garfield's mouth, staining his fur a dark crimson. He couldn't scream anymore. Jon's eyes rolled back into his head, as the cold grasp of death seduced him into oblivion.
