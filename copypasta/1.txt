"Garfield, you can't destroy Monday!" Jon cries out, to his disobedient cat, "Jon, I have infinite power, I can do anything." Jon watches in horror as Garfield uses his infinite power to speed up the orbit of the earth itself, removing 52 days from the year. All calenders have Monday burnt off of it. Clocks go a full 24 hours ahead. Everyone is confused at what just happened. It is now Tuesday. As everyone sees the ray of light over the horizon, they shout, "Garfield!"

"The tables have turned now Jon." Garfield says. Jon is nothing but a bug in his eyes. There is no turning back. There is no god. Only Garfield.
